## Technical Highlights

- **Frameworks & Languages**: Developed using **Python** (version 3.8) and **Django 5.1.1**, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilized machine learning models to predict loan approvals based on historical data. The model was trained using features such as applicant income, loan amount, and credit history.
- **API Development**: Implemented RESTful API endpoints for user interactions, employing Django REST Framework to handle CRUD operations efficiently.
- **Database Management**: Configured the application to use PostgreSQL through `dj_database_url`, ensuring seamless database connectivity and management.
- **Environment Management**: Utilized a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` for dependency management, making the project easily deployable and reproducible.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the application on **Railway**, demonstrating skills in cloud infrastructure and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) practices.
- **Input Validation**: Incorporated validation checks to ensure data integrity and enhance the reliability of the predictions.

## Key Features

- **User Interface**: A clean, user-friendly interface that allows applicants to submit their details effortlessly.
- **Data Validation**: Robust validation mechanisms to prevent erroneous data submissions, improving overall user experience.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Real-time predictions for loan approval status, offering users immediate feedback on their applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across different devices.
